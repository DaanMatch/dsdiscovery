## Program Requirements

The program offers variable units on a P/NP basis.

In order to receiving a passing grade:

- Students are only allowed to participate in 1 Discovery project per semester.
- Students are expected to commit 6 - 12 hours per week to their research project (the exact time commitment expected should be confirmed with the project partner). 1 unit of academic credit is available for every 3 hours of work per week. Students will be enrolled in a DATA 198 course for units when they join a project.
- All student teams are required to submit a Mid-Term Progress Report (this will be sent to you as a Google Form to fill out) and a Final Presentation during RRR week.

## Communication

At our company, we value clear and effective communication. To ensure that we are able to work together effectively, we have established the following communication expectations:

- **Meetings:** Meetings will be held weekly via Google Meet or Zoom. These meetings will provide an opportunity for us to discuss progress, share updates, and collaborate on projects.
- **Text Communication:** We will be using Slack for text-based communication. This platform will be used for quick questions, updates, and clarifications. Responses are expected within 24 hours.
- **Responsiveness:** We expect all team members to be responsive and timely in their communication. This means checking and responding to messages regularly, and being available for meetings and calls as scheduled.
- **Confidentiality:** Any sensitive information discussed during meetings or via text communication should be kept confidential and not shared outside of the team without proper authorization.

By adhering to these communication expectations, we can ensure that we are able to work together effectively and efficiently. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to your team leader or manager.
