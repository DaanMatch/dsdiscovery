# Phase 2: Gathering Additional data

Gather additional data on this [list of NGO Directories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Op1zqAMotvDs2e4zHPVHkri0gckNuUXizv_blo1Pcyw/edit?usp=sharing) through web scraping and automate the process using GitHub Actions in the [Webscrape Repository](https://github.com/DaanMatch/webscrape).

## Webscraping 101

```{admonition} General process for web scraping
:class: tip
1. **Identify the data to be extracted:** Determine what data you want to extract from the website, such as product prices, reviews, or images.
2. **Find the URLs to scrape:** Identify the URLs of the web pages containing the data you want to extract. This may involve navigating through multiple pages or categories.
3. **Inspect the HTML:** Use your web browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML structure of the web pages and identify the HTML tags and attributes that contain the data you want to extract.
4. **Send HTTP requests:** Use a programming language or web scraping tool to send HTTP requests to the URLs of the web pages and retrieve the HTML content.
5. **Parse the HTML:** Use an HTML parser or web scraping library to extract the relevant data from the HTML content. This may involve searching for specific HTML tags or attributes, or using regular expressions to extract patterns of text.
6. **Store the data:** Save the extracted data in a format such as CSV or JSON, or store it in a database for further analysis.
Handle errors and exceptions: Implement error handling and exception handling to deal with cases where the website is unavailable, the data is not in the expected format, or the scraping process is interrupted.

```{admonition} Popular Webscraping Libraries
:class: dropdown
1. **[BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner.
2. **[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org):** Scrapy is an open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python. It is used to extract the data from websites and stores it in structured data format such as CSV, JSON or XML.
3. **[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev):** Selenium is a web testing tool that can also be used for web scraping. It can automate web browsers and simulate user interactions with web pages, which can be useful for scraping dynamic websites.
4. **[Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/):** Requests is a simple and elegant Python library used for making HTTP requests to websites. It can be used to download HTML pages or other data from websites, which can then be parsed using other libraries such as BeautifulSoup.
5. **[Lxml](https://lxml.de):** Lxml is a Python library for processing XML and HTML documents. It provides a fast and efficient way to parse and manipulate XML and HTML data, which can be useful for web scraping.
6. **[PyQuery](https://pypi.org/project/pyquery/):** PyQuery is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It provides a jQuery-like syntax for querying and manipulating HTML documents.
```

## [Example](https://github.com/DaanMatch/webscrape) with Scrapy

1. **Create a new Scrapy project:** Use the command ```scrapy startproject <project_name>``` to create a new Scrapy project.
2. **Define the spider:** In the newly created project, navigate to the spiders directory and create a new Python file. This file will define the spider. Inside this file, define the name of the spider, the start URLs, and the parse function that will be used to extract data from the website.
3. **Extract data:** Inside the parse function, use Scrapy's selectors to extract the desired data from the website.
4. **Save data:** Once the data has been extracted, you can save it to a file or a database. You can use Scrapy's built-in Item Pipeline to process the extracted data and save it to a file or a database.
5. **Run the spider:** Use the command ```scrapy crawl <spider_name>``` to run the spider and start the web scraping process.

## Example

To scrape data from <https://www.indiangoslist.com>

- Create a new Scrapy project using the following command in your terminal:

```
scrapy startproject indiangoslist_scraper
```

- Create a new spider by running the following command in the terminal:

```
scrapy genspider indiangoslist_spider indiangoslist.com
```

- Define the parsing logic for the main page in the parse method of the spider.

Run the spider using the following command in your terminal:

```
scrapy crawl indiangoslist_spider -o indiangoslist_data.json
```

## TODO

- [ ]  Fork [Webscrape Repository](https://github.com/DaanMatch/webscrape)
- [ ] Create a branch using your name
- [ ] Create a script to web-scraper your domain
- [ ] Perform EDA on scraped data
- [ ] Review feedback from previous EDA task for [Codebook Repository](https://github.com/DaanMatch/Codebook), and update accordingly
- [ ] Short presentation on your domains, and a walk-through on how you scrapped your data.
