# Phase 2: Gathering Additional data

Gather additional data through web scraping and automate the process using GitHub Actions. The collected data will be uploaded to pgAdmin, where an entity-relationship (ER) diagram will be created to visualize the structure and relationships of the data. The ER diagram will help identify what's needed for data transformation.
