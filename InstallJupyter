# How to download Jupyter notebooks (on Mac)
# (Optional)
# First I’d recommend making a new folder like I just made a folder called “Daanmatch_Internship” in desktop, just to find files and stuff easier
# And then in terminal you can type in “cd desktop” and then “cd [your folder_name]” to navigate to the folder that you made

# Copy this line to download Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Copy this line to upgrade Homebrew
brew update && brew upgrade

# Copy this line to download Python
brew install python3

# Now you can copy this line!
pip3 install jupyterlab

# This is how you install a Jupyter notebook, copy this line into terminal
pip install notebook

# This is how you open the notebook, copy this line into terminal!
jupyter notebook
```
