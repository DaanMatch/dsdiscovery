We understand that you are eager to learn and grow, and we are excited to provide you with the opportunity to do so. You will have the chance to work with experienced professionals, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to meaningful projects. We are looking forward to your ideas and insights. This program will be a valuable experience for you, and we are excited to see you thrive during your time here at DaanMatch.

## Program Requirements

The program offers variable units on a P/NP basis.

In order to receiving a passing grade:

- Students are only allowed to participate in 1 Discovery project per semester.
- Students are expected to commit 6 - 12 hours per week to their research project (the exact time commitment expected should be confirmed with the project partner). 1 unit of academic credit is available for every 3 hours of work per week. Students will be enrolled in a DATA 198 course for units when they join a project.
- All student teams are required to submit a Mid-Term Progress Report (this will be sent to you as a Google Form to fill out) and a Final Presentation during RRR week.

## Communication

At our company, we value clear and effective communication. To ensure that we are able to work together effectively, we have established the following communication expectations:

- **Meetings:** Meetings will be held weekly via Google Meet or Zoom. These meetings will provide an opportunity for us to discuss progress, share updates, and collaborate on projects.
- **Text Communication:** We will be using Slack for text-based communication. This platform will be used for quick questions, updates, and clarifications. Responses are expected within 24 hours.
- **Responsiveness:** We expect all team members to be responsive and timely in their communication. This means checking and responding to messages regularly, and being available for meetings and calls as scheduled.
- **Confidentiality:** Any sensitive information discussed during meetings or via text communication should be kept confidential and not shared outside of the team without proper authorization.

By adhering to these communication expectations, we can ensure that we are able to work together effectively and efficiently. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to your team leader or manager.

## Development Environment

- [ ] Share GitHub username
- [ ] Set up local environment (virtual environment) and package managers (e.g. pip, anaconda etc.) or use Google Colab. Will not be able to use Berkeley's Jupyter Hub.

```{dropdown} Package Managers
Pip and Anaconda are both package managers for Python.

Pip is the default package manager for Python. It is a command-line tool that allows you to install, update, and manage Python packages. With pip, you can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of Python packages. You can install packages using the command "pip install package_name" and to upgrade packages "pip install --upgrade package_name".

Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with a lot of pre-installed packages for data science and machine learning. It also includes conda, which is an additional package manager that allows you to easily install, update, and manage packages from different sources. It also contains Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, and other tools that are commonly used in data science and machine learning workflows. With Anaconda you can create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and packages, which is useful to avoid version conflicts.

In summary, pip is a package manager that allows you to install and manage Python packages, while Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with a lot of pre-installed packages and additional tools for data science and machine learning, and also includes conda as a package manager.
